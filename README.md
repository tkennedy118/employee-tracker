## Description
This is a terminal based content management system that allows users to track a company database with employee, department, and role tables. Users are presented with options to view, update, and add table rows.

<a name="installation"></a>
## Installation
Users should run 'npm install' to require dependencies, which include:
* [mysql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql)
* [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)
* [figlet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/figlet)

It is also expected that users have a sql server running.

## Additions
The functionality of this application is fairly basic, but it can definitely be expanded upon for more complex query searches. Some examples would be to search all employees that are part of a specific department, or all employees who are managed by a specific person. Delete operations would also be a good addition.
